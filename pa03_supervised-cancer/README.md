# PA04 - Programming Assignment 4 - Supervised learning on gene data

## Task
Read a paper, write a summary, write some code to compete with it.

### TASK 0 (background)
Read the pdf publication in this repo (where the data came from).

### TASK 1:
* Implement the class `MyLearner` in python, in `supervised.py`.
* It mimics scikit-learn's object structure. 
  Thus, you will learn sklearn better, and learn an ML method better!
* You will train and test on the data files listed in the grader.

### TASK 2:
Summarize the paper itself, in at least 300 words in: `summary.md`.
I do actuall look at these, in this class at least ;)

## Execution
* See `./supervised.py` for an example main.
* See `./learning_test` for the test of your supervised learning.
* See `./grade.sh` for the mypy, black, and other tests.

## Things to check before submission
* Is your grade showing up on gitlab git-classes CI/CD?
* Did you write your paper summary?
